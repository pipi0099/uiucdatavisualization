                This chart shows the cumulative covid 19 cases in California, Oregon and Naveda over time to illustrate the comparison of number and acceleration rate of covid 19 cases in these geographically adjacent states. <br/>
                From the visualization below, due to difference in population and state restriction measures, the number and acceleration rate of covid 19 cases in geographically adjacent states are not directly related<br/><br/>

    <h4>About the indicator in WDI:</h4>
    <blockquote>
            The indicator of status in employment distinguishes between two categories of the total employed. These are: (a) wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and (b) self-employed workers. Self-employed group is broken down in the subcategories: self-employed workers with employees (employers), self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), members of producers' cooperatives and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). Vulnerable employment refers to the sum of contributing family workers and own-account workers. The series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.
